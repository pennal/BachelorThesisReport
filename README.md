# BachelorThesisReport

This repository contains all of the documentation and accompanying files for [WebDistiller](https://github.com/pennal/BachelorThesis)

## Report
The report can be found in the `Thesis` subfolder. To typeset the document you need the following:

 * Basic [LaTeX installation]('https://www.tug.org/texlive/')
 * [Pygments]('http://pygments.org') for syntax coloring

Once ready, there is a `build.sh` script included that will take care of generating the PDF:

```bash
cd Thesis
./build.sh
```

This will start the process of creating the PDF, and cleanup afterwards. 

## Plan
Contains an omniplan file with the plan used for the project

## Media

to complete the project, we were required to create a logo. You can find it in the `Media` subfolder

## Poster
The poster can be found in the `Poster` subfolder, with both the Pages document and the PDF export


ENJOY!
