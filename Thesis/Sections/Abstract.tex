LIBRA\cite{Ponz2017a} is a holistic recommender system that supports the developer in the process of searching and navigating the set of documents returned by a search engine like Google. Although LIBRA guides the user in finding pertinent material, it neither helps with reducing the information overload that may characterize resources that are too long and detailed for the task at hand, nor reduce the information overload occurring when multiple sources have to be aggregated and filtered. 

We introduce \projectName, a summarizer that monitors the pages viewed by a user, extracts the content and creates interactive extractive summaries of a single page or multiple pages, that the user can interact with and decide the amount of filtration she may want to see. The project also allows the user to generate a summary of everything she has seen up to a certain moment, and once again allowing to extract the most relevant sections to solve the task at hand.
