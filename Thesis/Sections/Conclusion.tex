\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented WebDistiller, a novel approach to reducing information overload. It is the combination of a holistic ranking approach, with a simple to use UI. Developers have now the ability to partially offload the task of filtering the content, allowing them to focus on the task at hand. By also providing a summary functionality, we provide the ability to see the previously seen pages, with an easy to use interface that allows them to filter the content once again, with the importance of each section based on the entire history, and not only the current document.
