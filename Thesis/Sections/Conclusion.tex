\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented WebDistiller, a novel approach to reducing information overload. It is the combination of a holistic ranking approach, with a simple to use user interface. Developers have now the ability to partially offload the task of filtering the content, allowing them to focus on the task at hand by consulting extractive summaries of the content being displayed. The summarisation is implemented in such a way that we consider the whole history, and not only the current document. We also implemented the ability to generate a summary of the developer's history, allowing them to have a high level overview of the previously seen documents.
