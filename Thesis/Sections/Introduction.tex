\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
To solve the task at hand, developers often rely on web resources. The knowledge that a developer may have is usually not enough, requiring further exploration of documentation, Q\&A sites, and tutorials \cite{A1}. Developers are then faced with a large availability of material, which has to be filtered by either using a few keywords provided by the search engine, or by opening the results deemed more important, and reading the content. It is then the task of the developer to collect all of the information found and filter it to find the relevant sections to solve the task at hand. Not only is this process straining, but it can lead to information overload.

To mitigate this phenomenon, summarization can be used as an effective way to automate part of the process, presenting developers only with a subset of the collected data. Summarization in software engineering is not new, and has been attempted before. Existing approaches include the summarization of email threads \cite{A4} to generate extractive summaries of bug reports as well as exploiting PageRank \cite{ilprints422} to create general summarization approaches for bug reports. 

The common limitation in the aforementioned approaches is the way artefacts are treated. In both cases, the techniques do not differentiate between purely text-based artefacts from code-based artefacts, but treat both as text-based artefacts. This limits the amount of information that may be extracted from a resource. 

Ponzanelli \textit{et al.} \cite{Ponz2015b} propose a novel approach where the heterogeneous nature of artefacts is considered when performing summarization. The proposed approach augments LexRank \cite{Erkan:2004:LGL:1622487.1622501} to deal with the heteregenous and multidimensional nature of complex artifacts, by providing a new similarity function for heterogeneous entities such as code samples. The current limitation is its scope, as they focus solely on Stack Overflow\footnote{http://stackoverflow.com/}, a very common Q\&A site among developers.

 In this project, we introduce \projectName, a tool which provides the ability to create interactive extractive summaries of a single page or set of pages. By integrating it with LIBRA \cite{Ponz2017a}, a holistic recommender system,  through the usage of HoliRank \cite{Ponz2017a}, an algorithm which builds on the foundations of PageRank\cite{ilprints422}, the heterogeneous nature of artefacts is considered when determining the prominence of a certain section of a document. We do not limit the scope, but try to use multiple sources, as to provide the most complete extractive summary to aid the developer in the task of filtering and choosing the most relevant parts of different documents to solve the task at hand.

In Section \ref{sec:stateOfTheArt} we take a look at existing approaches for both summarization as well as recommendation systems for Software Engineering. In Section \ref{sec:requirementsAndAnalysis} we analyze some of the challenges which we may be faced with, whereas in Section \ref{sec:projectDesign} we go in depth and discuss the implementation and design choices to create \projectName. In Section \ref{sec:results} we analyze the issues and limitations with our implementation, and in Section \ref{sec:implementationIssues} we explore the results.
