        abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

title="Recommending reference API documentation",
journal="Empirical Software Engineering",
year="2015",

pages="1558--1586",
abstract="Reference documentation is an important source of information on API usage. However, information useful to programmers can be buried in irrelevant text, or attached to a non-intuitive API element, making it difficult to discover. We propose to detect and recommend fragments of API documentation potentially important to a programmer who has already decided to use a certain API element. We categorize text fragments in API documentation based on whether they contain information that is indispensable, valuable, or neither. From the fragments that contain knowledge worthy of recommendation, we extract word patterns, and use these patterns to automatically find new fragments that contain similar knowledge in unseen documentation. We implemented our technique in a tool, Krec, that supports both information filtering and discovery. In an evaluation study with randomly-sampled method definitions from ten open source systems, we found that with a training set derived from about 1000 documentation units, we could issue recommendations with 90 {\%} precision and 69 {\%} recall. In a study involving ten independent assessors, indispensable knowledge items recommended for API types were judged useful 57 {\%} of the time and potentially useful an additional 30 {\%} of the time.",
